You'll need FastAPI, Strawberry, and Uvicorn:
```
pip install fastapi strawberry-graphql uvicorn
```

Strawberry
----------
Python library for building GraphQL APIs in a simple and type-safe way using Pythonâ€™s type hints.
It provides an easy-to-use and fully compatible GraphQL implementation that integrates well with FastAPI, Django,
and other Python web frameworks.

Asynchronous Support: Works well with async and await, making it great for modern applications.
Extensibility: Supports custom scalars (Primitive types like String, ...), middleware, and integration with ORMs like SQLAlchemy.

Uvicorn
-------
High-performance ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) web server for running Python web applications,
particularly FastAPI and Starlette.

Blazing Fast: Built on uvloop (a high-performance event loop) and httptools (a fast HTTP parser).
Supports WebSockets, HTTP/2, and background tasks.
