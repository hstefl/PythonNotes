Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible type
systems in object-oriented programming languages. In the context of Python, ORM allows developers to interact with
a database using Python objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. This abstraction layer simplifies database
operations and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Key Concepts of ORM
-------------------
Model Classes:
 * Each table in the database is represented by a class in Python.
 * Attributes of the class correspond to columns in the table.
 * Instances of the class correspond to rows in the table.

Querying:
 * ORM libraries provide methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
 * Queries are constructed using Python syntax instead of SQL.

Relationships:
 * ORM allows defining relationships between tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) using class attributes.

Migrations:
 * Some ORM frameworks include tools to manage database schema changes over time, known as migrations.


Popular Python ORM Libraries
----------------------------
SQLAlchemy:
 * One of the most powerful and widely used ORM libraries in Python.
 * Provides both high-level ORM capabilities and low-level database interaction.

Django ORM:
 * Comes built-in with the Django web framework.
 * Highly integrated with Django's other features, such as form handling and view templates.

Peewee:
 * A small, expressive ORM.
 * Simple to use and good for small applications.

Benefits of Using ORM
---------------------
Productivity: Speeds up development by allowing developers to work with higher-level abstractions.
Maintainability: Makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
Portability: Makes it easier to switch between different database systems.

Potential Drawbacks
---------------------
Performance: May not be as performant as writing raw SQL, especially for complex queries.
Abstraction Leakage: Some complex database features might be difficult to use through the ORM.

Using ORM in Python can significantly streamline the process of database interaction, making it more intuitive and
aligned with the principles of object-oriented programming.
