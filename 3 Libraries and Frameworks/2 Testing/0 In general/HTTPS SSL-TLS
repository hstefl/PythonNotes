HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):
  It's HTTP over SSL/TLS.
  Encrypts all data exchanged between the browser and the server.
  Protects against eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
    Eavesdropping
      Unauthorized party secretly listens to or intercepts private communications, such as data transmissions,
      phone calls, or messages, without the knowledge or consent of the involved parties
    Tampering
      Type of attack intentionally alters or manipulates data, systems, or communications to cause harm,
      gain advantage, or mislead others.
    Man-in-the-middle

Key Criteria for a Secure HTTPS/SSL/TLS Setup
 1. Valid SSL/TLS Certificate
   Issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
   Not expired or self-signed (unless explicitly needed).
   Matches the domain (common name/SAN check).

 2. Strong TLS Protocol
   Only TLS 1.2 or 1.3 should be enabled.
   Disable SSL 2.0, 3.0, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1, which are vulnerable.

 3. Secure Cipher Suites
   Use modern cipher suites that support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), like:
     ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
     ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256

 4. HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
   Enforces HTTPS-only traffic.
   Prevents downgrade attacks (e.g., forcing to HTTP).
   Sent via response header:
     Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload

 5. Certificate Transparency
   Signed certificates are logged in public CT logs.
   Helps detect fraudulent certificates.

 6. OCSP Stapling
   Improves performance and privacy of certificate revocation checking.
   Server sends OCSP response with the certificate to prove it hasn't been revoked.
